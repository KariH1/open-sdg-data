In the years 2007-2018, the number of intentional homicides ranged from zero to three per year. The number of murders per 100,000 population was therefore from 0\nto 0.9. During this period women were about one-third of victims of intentional homicides. Homicide is too rare to give a breakdown by the age distribution of victims.\n"}
