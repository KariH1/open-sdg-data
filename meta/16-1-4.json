It can be seen that 85.5% of the population felt very or fairly safe, and 46.1% felt very safe. Iceland has the sixth-highest proportion of those EU countries that participated in the 2013 SILC, regardless of whether this is measured by those who considered themselves very or fairly safe, or just those who felt very safe. The average for EU countries is 74.7%\n"}
