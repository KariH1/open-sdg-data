Statistics Iceland\nstarted this data collection again in 2017 after pausing for several years. In the study,\nsuch skills are analysed in four areas, i.e. 1) acquisition and retention of information;\n2) communication; 3) system skills; and 4) software. People\u2019s skills in each field are\nassessed on a three-step scale: 1) lack basic skills; 2) basic skills; 3) more than basic\nskills. Finally, a composite indicator of general skills is created that takes into account\nthe skills of people in different fields.\n\nThere is a correlation between age and skills in the use of information technology,\ni.e. almost everyone under the age of 45 has basic skills in all areas, but the skills\ndecrease with each increasing age group. Nevertheless, basic skills in all areas are\ncommon in the older age groups.\n"},"1-a-1":{"data_non_statistical":false,"goal_meta_link":"http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-1.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (pdf 894kB)","graph_type":"line","indicator":"1.a.1","indicator_name":"Proportion of domestically generated resources allocated by the government directly to poverty reduction programmes","indicator_sort_order":"01-aa-01","layout":"indicator","permalink":"/1-a-1/","published":true,"reporting_status":"notstarted","sdg_goal":"1","target":"Ensure significant mobilization of resources from a variety of sources, including through enhanced development cooperation, in order to provide adequate and predictable means for developing countries, in particular least developed countries, to implement programmes and policies to end poverty in all its dimensions","target_id":"1.a","graph_title":"Proportion of domestically generated resources allocated by the government directly to poverty reduction programmes","un_designated_tier":"3","national_data_update_url_text":"2018-10-20: see changes on GitHub","national_data_update_url":"https://github.com/hagstofan/open-sdg-data/commit/c668a137c13a542f480233edcff3476972c2b897","national_metadata_update_url_text":"2018-12-05: see changes on GitHub","national_metadata_update_url":"https://github.com/hagstofan/open-sdg-data/commit/324e97b64ed9aa4bd1a36d8ec47530a404d87d66","page_content":""},"1-5-3":{"data_non_statistical":true,"goal_meta_link":"https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-01-05-03.pdf","goal_meta_link_text":"United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Metadata (pdf 894kB)","graph_type":"line","indicator":"1.5.3","indicator_name":"Number of countries that adopt and implement national disaster risk reduction strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030","indicator_sort_order":"01-05-03","layout":"indicator","permalink":"/1-5-3/","published":true,"reporting_status":"complete","sdg_goal":"1","target":"By 2030, build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters","target_id":"1.5","graph_title":"Number of countries that adopt and implement national disaster risk reduction strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030","un_custodian_agency":"UNISDR","un_designated_tier":"1","national_geographical_coverage":"Iceland","data_keywords":"Non-statistical, legislation, policy","national_indicator_available":"Relevant Icelandic policies","comments_limitations":"Data follows the UN specification for this indicator.
