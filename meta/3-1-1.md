The Icelandic Directorate of Health collects data on this indicator. According to their data, two cases of maternal mortality were reported during the period 2000-2017. These concern deaths where the relationship to pregnancy and childbirth is clear. Since maternal mortality is very rare in Iceland, it is not appropriate to calculate it as a ratio of a certain number of births by year.
